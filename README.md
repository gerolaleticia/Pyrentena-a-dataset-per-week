# Pyrentena: a dataset per week

'Pyrentena' proposes a exploratory analysis of one dataset per week during the isolation period due COVID-19. 

Every friday I will upload the dataset of the week and a notebook with the complete analysis. Some of them might contain Machine Learning predictions :)

**Week 1: ENEM 2016**. This dataset was available for AceleraDev 2020 challenge, from Codenation. It brings data from the biggest national exam for college admissions in Brazil. **Question to be answered:** having internet at home and the level of schooling of the mother has any influence on the mathmatics grade of the students? How this develelop in each gender? Check out the complete [article about this dataset](https://medium.com/joguei-os-dados/pyrentena-a-dataset-per-week-877ccf370eac). 


**Week 2: Avocado prices**. This dataset is available here for download and also on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alanluo418/avocado-prices-20152019). It brings data of avocado sales in the USA market from 2015 to 2020. **Question to be answered:** The recent trend 'avocado toast' worshiped by millenials caused an **increase on the total volume of avocado sales?** What about the prices, have they increased since avocados are no longer the bad green smooth of childhood and are now an instagramable meal? Check out the complete [article about this dataset](https://medium.com/joguei-os-dados/week-2-avocado-dataset-2f52442116ae).

**Week 3: CO2 emission**. This dataset is available here and also on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gangliu/oc2emission/tasks). It brings data of car motors and its characteristics and the correspondent CO2 emission of the vehicle on the atmosphere. **Question to be answered:** what is the correlation between the engine motor of the car and its CO2 emission? Is it possible to create a model that predicts the amount of polution on future motors? Check ou the complete article about this Machine Learning model.
